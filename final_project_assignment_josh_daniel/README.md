This is a quick guide to using our API displayed in  the final assignment

- The final project should only be tested in its original directory and environment, as the code contains specific working directories. 
- The project was made in python using Jupyter Notebook in an Anaconda environment. Furthermore, the final project is done with the Salling Group API (https://developer.sallinggroup.com/) and requires an account and authentification key, which is a free service.
- You will need to register for a authentification key at: https://developer.sallinggroup.com/api-reference#introduction-quick-start or you may use the one we have provided in the source code. The API only provides 200 requests per day. (date: 06/01/2023)
